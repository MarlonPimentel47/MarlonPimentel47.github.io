                    to joining Google, Marlon interned at Bloomberg LP in the Operations department 
                    and at IBM as a full-stack software developer. 
                    <br><br>
                    In his senior year of high school, Marlon was named a Bloomberg Technology Scholar, 
                    bringing along a $40,000 scholarship. After graduating as Salutorian of his 
                    class, Marlon attended Binghamton University where he majored in Mathematics. 
                    At Binghamton, Marlon took computer science courses and gained most of his software 
                    knowledge from reading online books and building applications. In 2019, Marlon 
                    received an internship offer from IBM which officially began his career in technology.

                    Government and Justice. His biggest inspirations are his parents who have showed him 
                    what kindness and hard-work looks like and where it can take you. Other inspirations include
                    Ryan Serhant, Nipsey Hussle, Chamath Palihapitiya, B-boy Ynot and Scooter Braun. Marlon is currently a tutor
